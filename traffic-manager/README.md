WSO2 Traffic Manager (WSO2 APIM-TM) is a powerful platform for creating, managing, consuming, and
monitoring web APIs. It combines tried and tested SOA best practices with modern
day API management principles to solve a wide range of enterprise challenges
associated with API provisioning, governance, and integration.

WSO2 Traffic Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as reusable Carbon
components.
