# API Rate Limiting

### Sample use case

##### API Rate Limiting

* For monetization purposes, to enforce limits on an Application based on its subscriptions

* Enforce fair usage policy among an applicationâ€™s users

* Allow privileged rate limits based on location, device type, user credentials, etc.

* Enforce a peak limit on back-end services to prevent total outages.

### Business Story

* ABC organization has an API to expose there mobile phone prices. This organization currently exposes prices to the sales agents and they have a large number of third party sales agents.
 
* They need to limit the total number of API calls to 50PerMin for this mobile price API
 
* They need to limit the number of requests to 5000, when specific third party agent calls the mobile price API.
 
* They need to allow API calls coming from a specific location (IP address - 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.100) and they need to restrict specific device types such as mobiles.
 
* Even though they allow a specific number of API calls for a given period of time, they need to limit the API calls that come at a given point in time to restrict the burst requests and to prevent their back end service.

### Business Use Cases

* For the above mentioned business story ABC organization needs to have and API manager solution to expos there mobile price API.

* They need to limit the the number of API calls that invokes by a specific third party agent

* They need to limit the number of API calls that invokes by all the agents in a given period of time frame

* They need to control the number of request comes from specific devices, locations

* They need to control the number of requests comes at given time to limit the burst requests.

### Implement using WSO2 API Manager

In WSO2 API Manager we need to,

* Create an API to expose there mobile phone prices.

* Create a Application throttle policy to the number of API calls that comes from all the third party agents that subscribes through that application

* Create a Subscription throttle policy to limit the number of API calls from a specific third party agent

* Add a Burst Control (Rate Limiting) to the subscription policy to prevent the burst requests that can come for a given time.

By executing the scenario 10 using the run.sh as mentioned below will add the sample data relate the the above business use case to WSO2 API Manager distribution

### Running the sample

1. Start the wso2am-2.6.0 is distribution by executing **[APIM_HOME]**/bin/wso2server.sh or **[APIM_HOME]**/bin/wso2server.bat

2. Run the file run.sh in sample scenarios root directory**[APIM_HOME/sample-scenarios] **as ./run.sh and enter number 10.

#### User credentials needed for login to API Manager instance which the sample data is populated

Username: admin

Password: admin
