    <h1>WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0-Alpha Released!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 API Manager team is pleased to announce the release of version 4.0.0-Alpha of
    the Open Source API Manager.
</p>

<p>
    The WSO2 API Manager is a fully open source full lifecycle API Management product that can be deployed on-prem, <br/>
    available on SaaS, deployed on a private cloud or deployed in a hybrid model. It is comprised of the following <br/>
    components that provides all of its functionality.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>API Designer and Publisher:</b> Allows API creators to design, implement and document APIs and <br/>
    allows API product managers to manage the lifecycle of APIs and create API products by using one or more APIs.</li><br/>
    <li><b>Developer Portal:</b> A portal for onboarding application creators. It allows application creators to discover, <br/> 
    subscribe, test and consume APIs through their applications.</li><br/>
    <li><b>API Gateway:</b> Allows access to APIs/services by routing application traffic to the relevant endpoints. <br/>
    The API Gateway is the component that enforces security, rate-limiting and transformations on API requests while <br/>
    feeding valuable information of these requests to API Analytics.</li><br/>
    <li><b>Key Manager:</b> The security token service of the API Manager which is responsible for  handling everything <br/>
    related to authentication and authorization of API requests. It supports a wide variety of security protocols such <br/>
    as OAuth2.0/OIDC, Basic Auth, API Key, SAML based single-sign-on.</li><br/>
    <li><b>Traffic Manager:</b> Controls the traffic flow of the API gateway. This is used to apply request quotas on APIs <br/>
    for monetization, access control or security related matters. In addition to configuring the available policies, users <br/>
    can deploy their own policies on the traffic manager which will control the rate of traffic on the API gateways.</li><br/>
    <li><b>API Analytics:</b> Monitors all traffic thatâ€™s routed through the API gateways to analyse usage patterns, <br/>
    SLA violations, consumer behaviours, to provide business insights and so on.</li>
</ul>
