                               WSO2 API Manager
================================================================================

WSO2 API Manager is a powerful platform for creating, managing, consuming and
monitoring web APIs. It combines tried and tested SOA best practices with modern
day API management principles to solve a wide range of enterprise challenges
associated with API provisioning, governance and integration.

WSO2 API Manager consists of several loosely coupled modules.

        * API publisher
        * API store
        * API gateway
	    * API Key Manager

The API publisher module allows API publishers to easily define APIs and manage them
using a strong governance model which consists of well-established concepts such as
versioning and lifecycles. API consumers can use the API store module to discover
published, production-ready APIs and access them in a secure and reliable manner
using unique API keys.  The built-in API gateway module provides powerful tools to
secure and control the load on individual APIs.

WSO2 API Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as reusable Carbon
components.
