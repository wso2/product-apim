                               WSO2 API Manager
================================================================================

WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) is a powerful platform for creating, managing, consuming, 
and monitoring web APIs. It combines tried and tested SOA best practices with modern 
day API management principles to solve a wide range of enterprise challenges associated 
with API provisioning, governance, and integration.

WSO2 API Manager consists of several loosely coupled modules.

        * API publisher
        * API Developer Portal
        * API gateway
	    * API Key Manager
	    * API Traffic Manager

The API publisher module allows API publishers to easily define APIs and manage them 
using a strong governance model that consists of well-established concepts such as, 
versioning and lifecycles. API consumers can use the API Developer Portal module to discover
published, production-ready APIs and access them in a secure and reliable manner 
using unique API keys. The built-in API Gateway module provides powerful tools to 
secure and control the load on individual APIs.

WSO2 API Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as reusable Carbon
components.

Key Features
=============

* Design and Prototype APIs:   
      - Design APIs, gather developer's feedback before implementing (API First Design).
      - Design can be done from the publishing interface or by importing an existing Swagger 
      definition.
      - Deploy a prototyped API, provide early access to APIs, and get early feedback.
      - Mock API implementation using Javascript.
      - Support publishing SOAP, REST, JSON, and XML style services as XML.    
    
* Create a Developer Portal of All Available APIs:
      - Graphical experience similar to Android Marketplace or Apple App Store.
      - Browse APIs by provider, tags, or name.
      - Self-registration to developer community to subscribe to APIs.
      - Subscribe to APIs and manage subscriptions on per-application basis.
      - Subscriptions can be at different service tiers based on the expected usage levels.
      - Role based access to API Developer Portal, which helps to manage public and private APIs.
      - Manage subscriptions per-developer.
      - Browse API documentation, download helpers for easy consumption.
      - Comment on and rate APIs.
      - Forum for discussing API usage issues (Available soon in a future version).
