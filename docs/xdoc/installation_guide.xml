            This document describes the distribution packages available in WSO2 ESB -
            the binary distribution and the source distribution for more advanced
            users. It is followed by simple instructions on how to install and run
            WSO2 ESB using the binary distribution and how to build WSO2 ESB using the
            source distribution.

                            transport and try out JMS samples. The ActiveMQ client libraries must
                            be installed in the ESB classpath before you can enable the JMS transport.
                            Alternatively you may use the built-in Qpid broker that comes with
                            WSO2 ESB.

            The WSO2 ESB build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache
            Maven 2</a>. Hence, it is a prerequisite to have Maven (version 2.2.0 or later)
            and JDK (version 1.6.x) installed in order to build WSO2 ESB from the
            source distribution. Extensive instructions on using Maven 2 are available
            on the Maven website.

                Set the 'Environment Variables' (create the system variable M2_HOME
                and edit the path. e.g., "C:\Program Files\Apache Software
                Foundation\maven-2.2.1"; path %M2_HOME%\bin)

            Once Maven is properly installed, you can start building the WSO2 ESB.
        </p>

                <a href="http://wso2.org/downloads/esb/">Download</a>
                the source distribution, which is available as a zip archive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract the source archive to a directory of your choice.
            </li>
            <li>
                All the necessary build scripts are included with the source distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can run the following command inside that directory to build the
                WSO2 ESB. Note that you will require a connection to the Internet for the Maven build
                to download dependencies required for the build.
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Command: <strong>mvn clean install</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This will create the complete release artifacts including the binary and
            source distributions in the modules/distribution/target/ directory which can be installed using
            the above instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: The first time you run Maven it will automatically download the
            dependency jar files. Therefore, the first run will take more time. It is also
            recommended to allocate for memory for Maven since the ESB build process takes up
            a significant amount of resources. More memory can be allocated for Maven by setting
            the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable.
