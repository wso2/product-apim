<h2>Target</h2>

<p>Target is a common configuration used across many ESB conofugrations. Some
mediators that uses this configuration are Clone, Iterate and Router. </p>

<p>A target specifies a mediation sequence, and endpoint or both. If a sequnce
is specified it will be executed. If a endpoint is specified message will be
sent to the endpoint. If both sequence and endpoint are specified, first
sequence will be executed and then endpoint will be executed.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lt;target [sequence="string"] [endpoint="string"]&gt;
    &lt;sequence ....../&gt;?
    &lt;endpoint ....../&gt;?
  &lt;/target&gt;  </pre>

<h3>UI Configuration</h3>

alt="" /> </p>

<p>Here you can prepare a message to send to an endpoint or mediate through
some more sequences. </p>
<ul>
  <li>SOAP Action: The SOAP action of the message. </li>
  <li>To Address: Then target endpoint address. </li>
  <li>Sequence: Mediate the message through a sequence. You can either pick a
    named sequence from the registry or define an anonymous sequence by adding
    mediators to the current Target mediator as children. </li>
  <li>Endpoint: Send the message to an endpoint. Here you can pick a named
    endpoint from the registry (which you can add in the Endpoint panel that
    can be accessed from the Manage-&gt; Mediation-&gt; Endpoints menu in the
    left hand side menu bar.) or keep the endpoint as anonymous. </li>
</ul>
