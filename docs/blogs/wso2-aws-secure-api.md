# Secure API Management with WSO2 API Manager and AWS

APIs are the backbone of modern applications, but managing them securely and efficiently can be challenging. In this blog post, we explore how WSO2 API Manager, combined with AWS services, simplifies API management while improving security, scalability, and monitoring.

## Why API Management Matters

As applications grow, managing hundreds of APIs becomes complex. You need to:
- Control who can access your APIs.
- Monitor API usage and performance.
- Ensure APIs are secure from threats.
- Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse.

WSO2 API Manager provides a complete solution for these challenges with features like API publishing, analytics, security, and throttling.

## Integrating AWS with WSO2 API Manager

Using AWS services alongside WSO2 can enhance API management capabilities:

- **AWS Lambda**: Run backend logic without managing servers. Connect APIs in WSO2 to Lambda functions for dynamic processing.
- **AWS S3**: Use for storing and serving static resources securely behind your APIs.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitor API traffic and latency metrics in real-time.

### Example: Securing an API

1. Create an API in WSO2 API Manager.
2. Apply OAuth2 authentication.
3. Enable rate limiting policies.
4. Connect the backend to an AWS Lambda function.
5. Monitor API calls via CloudWatch dashboards.

This integration ensures secure, scalable, and observable APIs without complex setups.

## Benefits

- Centralized API management with role-based access.
- Easy integration with cloud services like AWS.
- Reduced operational overhead through automation.
- Improved insights into API usage and performance.

## Conclusion

WSO2 API Manager combined with AWS services allows developers to focus on building innovative applications without worrying about API security, scaling, or monitoring. Itâ€™s a powerful combination for modern enterprise applications.
