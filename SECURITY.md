## Reporting Vulnerabilities

WSO2 takes security issues very seriously. If you have any concerns regarding our product security or have uncovered a security vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report that to our private and highly confidential security mailing list: security@wso2.com first, without disclosing them in any forums, sites or other groups - public or private. To protect the end-user security, these issues could be disclosed in other places only after WSO2 completes its [Vulnerability Management Process](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/WSO2+Security+Vulnerability+Management+Process).

**Warning** : Please do not create GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

[WSO2 guidelines for reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/WSO2+Security+Vulnerability+Reporting+Guidelines) page describes how to report a Security Vulnerability and includes a public key if you wish to send secure messages to security@wso2.com
