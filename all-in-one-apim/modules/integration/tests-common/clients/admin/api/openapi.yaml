    This document specifies a **RESTful API** for WSO2 **API Manager** - **Admin Portal**.
    Please see [full OpenAPI Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wso2/carbon-apimgt/v6.7.206/components/apimgt/org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.rest.api.admin.v1/src/main/resources/admin-api.yaml) of the API which is written using [OAS 3.0](http://swagger.io/) specification.

    # Authentication
    Our REST APIs are protected using OAuth2 and access control is achieved through scopes. Before you start invoking
    the the API you need to obtain an access token with the required scopes. This guide will walk you through the steps
    that you will need to follow to obtain an access token.
    First you need to obtain the consumer key/secret key pair by calling the dynamic client registration (DCR) endpoint. You can add your preferred grant types
    in the payload. A sample payload is shown below.
    ```
      {
      "callbackUrl":"www.google.lk",
      "clientName":"rest_api_admin",
      "owner":"admin",
      "grantType":"client_credentials password refresh_token",
      "saasApp":true
      }
    ```
    Create a file (payload.json) with the above sample payload, and use the cURL shown bellow to invoke the DCR endpoint. Authorization header of this should contain the
    base64 encoded admin username and password.
    **Format of the request**
    ```
      curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic Base64(admin_username:admin_password)" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      \ -d @payload.json https://<host>:<servlet_port>/client-registration/v0.17/register
    ```
    **Sample request**
    ```
      curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      \ -d @payload.json https://localhost:9443/client-registration/v0.17/register
    ```
    Following is a sample response after invoking the above curl.
    ```
    {
    "clientId": "fOCi4vNJ59PpHucC2CAYfYuADdMa",
    "clientName": "rest_api_admin",
    "callBackURL": "www.google.lk",
    "clientSecret": "a4FwHlq0iCIKVs2MPIIDnepZnYMa",
    "isSaasApplication": true,
    "appOwner": "admin",
    "jsonString": "{\"grant_types\":\"client_credentials password refresh_token\",\"redirect_uris\":\"www.google.lk\",\"client_name\":\"rest_api_admin\"}",
    "jsonAppAttribute": "{}",
    "tokenType": null
    }
    ```
    Next you must use the above client id and secret to obtain the access token.
    We will be using the password grant type for this, you can use any grant type you desire.
    You also need to add the proper **scope** when getting the access token. All possible scopes for Admin REST API can be viewed in **OAuth2 Security** section
    of this document and scope for each resource is given in **authorizations** section of resource documentation.
    Following is the format of the request if you are using the password grant type.
    ```
    curl -k -d "grant_type=password&username=<admin_username>&password=<admin_passowrd>&scope=<scopes seperated by space>"
    \ -H "Authorization: Basic base64(cliet_id:client_secret)"
    \ https://<host>:<gateway_port>/token
    ```
    **Sample request**
    ```
    curl https://localhost:8243/token -k \
    -H "Authorization: Basic Zk9DaTR2Tko1OVBwSHVjQzJDQVlmWXVBRGRNYTphNEZ3SGxxMGlDSUtWczJNUElJRG5lcFpuWU1h" \
    -d "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin&scope=apim:admin apim:tier_view"
    ```
    Shown below is a sample response to the above request.
    ```
    {
    "access_token": "e79bda48-3406-3178-acce-f6e4dbdcbb12",
    "refresh_token": "a757795d-e69f-38b8-bd85-9aded677a97c",
    "scope": "apim:admin apim:tier_view",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
    }
    ```
    Now you have a valid access token, which you can use to invoke an API.
    Navigate through the API descriptions to find the required API, obtain an access token as described above and invoke the API with the authentication header.
    If you use a different authentication mechanism, this process may change.

    # Try out in Postman
    If you want to try-out the embedded postman collection with "Run in Postman" option, please follow the guidelines listed below.
    * All of the OAuth2 secured endpoints have been configured with an Authorization Bearer header with a parameterized access token. Before invoking any REST API resource make sure you run the `Register DCR Application` and `Generate Access Token` requests to fetch an access token with all required scopes.
    * Make sure you have an API Manager instance up and running.
    * Update the `basepath` parameter to match the hostname and port of the APIM instance.

          **Search condition**.
          You can search in attributes by using **"conditionType:"** modifier and **"conditionValue:"** modifier.
          Eg.
          The entry "conditionType:API" will result in a match with blocking conditions only if the conditionType is "API". Similarly, "conditionValue:test/1.0.0" will result in a match with blocking conditions only if the conditionValue is "test/1.0.0".
          When you use "conditionType:API & conditionValue:test/1.0.0" as a combination, it will result in a match with blocking conditions only if both the conditionType is "API" and the conditionValue is "test/1.0.0".
          If query attribute is provided, this returns the blocking conditions that match the specified attributes.
          Please note that you need to use encoded URL (URL encoding) if you are using a client which does not support URL encoding (such as curl)
