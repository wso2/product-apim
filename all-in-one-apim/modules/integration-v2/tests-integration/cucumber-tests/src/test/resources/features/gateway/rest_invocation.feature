Feature: Gateway REST API Invocation

  Gateway-plane runtime invocation of a published REST API: subscribe an application, obtain an access
  token, and invoke the API through the gateway expecting a 200. This is the gateway counterpart of the
  publisher-plane create/publish features (which assert only publisher outcomes). Runs in both the super
  tenant and tenant1.com as the tenant admin (the flow spans publish + subscribe + invoke). Teardown via
  the per-scenario cleanup hook.

  Scenario Outline: Invoke a published REST API through the gateway as <actor>
    Given The system is ready
    And I have valid access tokens as "<actor>"
    And I have created an api from "artifacts/payloads/create_apim_test_api.json" as "createdApiId" and deployed it
    When I publish the "apis" resource with id "createdApiId"
    Then The lifecycle status of API "createdApiId" should be "Published"

    # Capture the API's full gateway context (already carries /t/<tenant> for tenant APIs)
    When I retrieve the "apis" resource with id "createdApiId"
    And I extract response field "context" and store it as "apiContext"

    # Subscribe an application and obtain an access token
    When I have set up application with keys, subscribed to API "createdApiId", and obtained access token for "subscriptionId"
    Then The response status code should be 200

    # Invoke through the gateway by full context path (retry while the gateway becomes eventually consistent)
    When I invoke the API at gateway context "{{apiContext}}/1.0.0/customers/123/" with method "GET" using access token "generatedAccessToken" and payload "" until response status code becomes 200 within 60 seconds
    Then The response status code should be 200

    Examples:

      | admin             |

  # Ports APIResourceWithTemplate #3 — an encoded URI path segment must be routed to the backend. FAITHFUL to
  # legacy: uri-template resource /{val} + a {uri.var.val} TEMPLATED ENDPOINT (…/echo/sub{uri.var.val}). The
  # gateway substitutes the path var into the endpoint AND appends the postfix → doubled backend path
  # /echo/sub<val>/<val> (exactly what legacy's bespoke Synapse backend hardcoded). The encoded segment must be
  # sent RAW (%28/%29 preserved) — the default invoke's HTTP client would decode it, which a uri-template
  # resource then 404s; the raw invoke sends it verbatim so the gateway routes it (as legacy's client did).

  Scenario Outline: An encoded URI path segment is routed through a templated endpoint to the backend as <actor>
    Given The system is ready
    And I have valid access tokens as "<actor>"
    And I have created an api from "artifacts/payloads/create_apim_uritemplate_api.json" as "uriApiId" and deployed it

    And I extract response field "context" and store it as "uriApiContext"
    When I have set up application with keys, subscribed to API "uriApiId", and obtained access token for "uriSubscriptionId"
    Then The response status code should be 200
    # Plain segment: routes through the {uri.var.val} endpoint; backend gets the doubled path /echo/subplainseg/plainseg.
    When I invoke the API at gateway context "{{uriApiContext}}/1.0.0/plainseg" with method "GET" using access token "generatedAccessToken" and payload "" until response status code becomes 200 within 60 seconds
    Then The response status code should be 200
    And The response should contain "echo/subplainseg/plainseg"
    # Encoded segment: sent RAW so %28/%29 reach the gateway verbatim; it routes (legacy uri-template + uri-var
    # endpoint) and the backend receives the encoding intact.
    When I invoke the API at raw gateway context "{{uriApiContext}}/1.0.0/S2222-0496%2815%2927436-0" using access token "generatedAccessToken" until response status code becomes 200 within 60 seconds
    Then The response status code should be 200
    And The response should contain "S2222-0496%2815%2927436-0"

  # L5: an API whose context uses a version-FIRST template ({version}/<ctx>) deploys to /{version}/<ctx> and is
  # invocable there — the version sits first in the URL, not appended. Ports PluggableVersioningStrategyTestCase
  # (the API is created with context "{version}/api"). The deployed context already carries the version, so it
  # is invoked directly (no appended /1.0.0) — that's what proves the version-first routing.

    # The publisher returns the context template verbatim (/{version}/ctx); the gateway resolves {version} at

    And I replace "{version}" with "1.0.0" in context "vfContext"
    When I have set up application with keys, subscribed to API "vfApiId", and obtained access token for "subscriptionId"
