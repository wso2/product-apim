<h1>Server Roles</h1>

    <p>A server-role is a parameter that is mentioned in carbon.xml for wso2carbon based products.
       Each product has a different default ServerRoles property in its carbon.xml. Default server
       role values for WSO2Carbon based products are as follows.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>WSO2 AppServer - "ApplicationServer"</li>
        <li>WSO2 BAM - "BusinessActivityMonitor"</li>
        <li>WSO2 BPS - "BusinessProcessServer"</li>
        <li>WSO2 BRS - "BusinessRulesServer"</li>
        <li>WSO2 DSS - "DataServicesServer"</li>
		<li>WSO2 ESB - "EnterpriseServiceBus"</li>
        <li>WSO2 GS - "GadgetServer"</li>
        <li>WSO2 GReg - "GovernanceRegistry"</li>
        <li>WSO2 IS - "IdentityServer"</li>
        <li>WSO2 MS - "MashupServer"</li>
   </ul>
  <p>This property value is used for deployment of C-App archives. Generally a C-App consists of a
     set of resources that is to be deployed in different products. So if an user deploys a C-App
     in a carbon product all of the resources cannot be deployed in that particular product instance.
     To sort out which can be deployed and which is can't server-role property is used. When a C-App
     is being deployed it reads the ServerRoles property in carbon.xml and deploys only the
     resources which matches the server-role values in there. Here is a example list of C-App
     resources that map to default server roles.</p>
  
  	<ul>
		<li>ApplicationServer - foo.aar, jax-wx.jar</li>
		<li>EnterpriseServiceBus - proxy.xml</li>
		<li>BusinessProcessServer - my_bpel.zip</li>
		<li>GadgetServer - gadget.xml</li>
  	</ul>
