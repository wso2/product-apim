Migration Instructions
======================

APIM 1.4.0 release has new API Documentation feature based on Swagger. When new API is created in APIM 1.4.0, The API Definition for that API is saved as a registry resource. When API store is loading it looks for this registry resource. This migration client will add the registry resource for existing APIs.
