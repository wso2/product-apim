            payment from the Reseller.

      7.2   Instead of an Order submitted to WSO2, Your order details will be as stated in the order placed with WSO2

            communicated to WSO2.

      7.3   If You are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless otherwise specified by WSO2, WSO2 will

            appropriate amounts to You.

      7.4   Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on WSO2's
            behalf, and WSO2 is not bound by any obligations to You other than as set forth in this Agreement.

            purposes of calculating the liability cap in Section 13.

  9.  Fees and Payment

      9.1   Fees. After You authorize an Order, upon renewal of a Subscription, or for other fees due to WSO2, WSO2
            will send you an invoice. You will pay all fees specified in invoices. All payments are due within thirty
            (30) calendar days of receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel
            performance of all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its credit terms (after
            notifying You) if actual payment is not received within sixty (60) calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's
            invoice. Payments past due sixty (60) calendar days will incur interest at the rate of one and one-half
            percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In any proceeding
            rought by WSO2 to collect amounts due, WSO2 will also receive its actual costs of collection, including
            reasonable attorneys' fees.

      9.2   Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any taxes
            arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, sales, service, use or value
            added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy, duty,
            customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed
            (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes
            based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or regulation,
            domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable
            to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the sum it
            would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.

      9.3   Purchase Orders. Any pre-printed terms on any purchase order that is issued by You that are in addition to
            or in conflict with the terms of this Agreement are null and void.

            the sole and exclusive remedy of Subscriber and the entire liability of WSO2, or any of the officers,

      15.9  Agreement to Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.  Each party agrees to the applicable governing law
            above, and to the exclusive method of dispute resolution. Where the applicable dispute resolution
            procedure is arbitration, the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties,
            and judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in the above provision
            prevents either party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive
            relief. Any dispute or other action arising out of this Agreement must be brought within one year of the
            date the cause of action accrued. An action for nonpayment may be brought within two years of the date of
            last payment.

      15.10 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Australia Pty Limited. Based upon the above, If You enter into this
            Agreement with WSO2 Australia Pty Limited, Sections 5.8, 9.2, and 13 are replaced with the following:

            5.8   Remedies. IF ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AT LAW, THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                  LAW, WSO2'S SOLE LIABILITY AND SUBSCRIBER'S SOLE REMEDY FOR BREACH OF A WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR
                  OBLIGATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED (AT WSO2'S OPTION) IN THE CASE OF: (A) SERVICES, TO THE
                  RESUPPLY OF THE SERVICES OR PAYMENT OF THE COST OF THE SAME; AND (B) GOODS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE), TO
                  THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE GOODS, SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT GOODS OR PAYMENT OF THE COST OF THE
                  SAME.

            9.2   Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any
                  taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, GST, use or value
                  added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy,
                  duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority
                  imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however,
                  any taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or
                  regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then
                  the sum payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount
                  equal to the sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.

                  Where a supply under this Agreement is a taxable supply, all amounts payable or other consideration
                  provided must be increased by the amount of GST payable in relation to the supply.  All GST must be
                  paid at the time any payment for any supply to which it relates is payable (provided a valid tax
                  invoice has been issued for the supply).  In this Section, "GST", "tax invoice" and "taxable supply"
                  have the meanings given to them in the A New Tax Systems (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).

            13.   Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH) WHICH
                  SHALL BE UNLIMITED, WSO2'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
                  WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), IS LIMITED IN ANY
                  CALENDAR YEAR TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY SUBSCRIBER FOR SERVICES DURING  THAT CALENDAR YEAR. IF YOU HAVE
                  PAID NO FEES, OR ARE A NON-COMMERCIAL, EDUCATIONAL, OR TRIAL LICENSEE, WSO2'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE
                  LIABILITY TO YOU IS $100. IN NO EVENT WILL WSO2 BE LIABLE FOR ANY "INDIRECT LOSSES" BEING: (A)
                  DOWNTIME COSTS, LOST BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS OR
                  OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, COSTS OF SOFTWARE
                  RESTORATION; AND (B) ANY LOSS THAT DOES NOT ARISE NATURALLY OR ACCORDING TO THE USUAL COURSE OF
                  THINGS FROM A BREACH, ACT OR OMISSION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OF THE
                  FOREGOING ARE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WSO2 HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                  ANY OF THE FOREGOING. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING
                  NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH, DEFAMATION, INFRINGEMENT OF PUBLICITY, PRIVACY, OR
                  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY OTHER CONTRACT OR TORT CLAIM.

      15.11 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Germany GmbH. Based upon the above, If You enter into this Agreement
            with WSO2 Germany GmbH, Sections 6.5, 9.1, and 9.2 are replaced with the following:

            6.5   Non-solicitation. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after its
                  termination, neither party will directly (a) solicit for hire or engagement any of the other party's
                  personnel who were involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement or (b) hire
                  or engage any person or entity who is or was employed or engaged by the other party and who was
                  involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180)
                  calendar days following the termination of the person's or entity's employment or engagement with
                  the other party. For purposes herein, "solicit" does not include broad-based recruiting efforts,
                  including without limitation help wanted advertising and posting of open positions on a party's
                  internet site. If You hire or engage directly or indirectly any personnel of WSO2 in violation of
                  this section, You will pay WSO2 a contractual penalty equal to three times the monthly billing rate
                  (assuming 168 hours per month) for such personnel.

            9.1   Fees. After You sign an Order, or upon renewal of a Subscription, WSO2 will send you an invoice. You
                  will pay all fees specified in invoices. All payments are due within thirty (30) calendar days of
                  receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel performance of
                  all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its credit terms (after notifying You) if
                  actual payment is not received within sixty (60) calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's invoice.
                  Payments past due sixty (60) calendar days will incur interest at the rate of 9 percentage points
                  above the ECB basic interest rate per year. In addition, Subscriber has to pay 40 EUR in recovering
                  charges. In any proceeding brought by WSO2 to collect amounts due, WSO2 will also receive its actual
                  costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

            9.2   Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any
                  taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, VAT which is paid by
                  or is payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy, duty, customs fee, charge,
                  contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without
                  limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes based solely on
                  the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or
                  foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable to WSO2
                  will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the sum it would
                  have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.
