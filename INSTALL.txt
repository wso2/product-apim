Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration.
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to
secure them with default mode.

    On Linux: ./ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure
    On Windows: ./ciphertool.bat -Dconfigure

System Requirements
=======================
1. Minimum memory - 4 GB RAM (2 GB for JVM and 2 GB for the operating system)
2. Processor      - 3 GHz Dual-core Xeon/Opteron (or latest)
3. Java 11.0 or higher
4. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
5. To compile and run the sample clients in <APIM_HOME>/samples, an Ant version is required. Ant 1.7.0
   version is recommended
6. To build WSO2 APIM from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have
   JDK 11 version and Maven 3.0.4 or later
